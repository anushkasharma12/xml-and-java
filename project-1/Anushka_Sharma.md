In this project we have tried to create a list of Cars at a showroom.
I created the HTML and JS part of the project.
I have used some styling in HTML head, and in the body of the HTML we have our filter form and an empty table which consists of the column names only. I have tried to load the data from the cars.xml file using the nodes.map function.
I have created text field which can be used to filter the form using the text inputs. In this textfield we can enter anything related to the data in the tabel. We have checkboxes for the selection of the country so that the user can select multiple countries at once. Checkboxes allow us to select multiple entries at once.
We have radio buttons for selecting the availability of cars in the showroom. The user can select only one of the two options available.
