In this project we have tried to create a list of Cars at a showroom.
I created the HTML and JS part of the project.
I have used some styling in HTML head, and in the body of the HTML we have our filter form and an empty table which consists of the column names only. I have tried to load the data from the cars.xml file using the nodes.map function.
I have created text field which can be used to filter the form using the text inputs.
